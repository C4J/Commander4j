
JasperReports Library 6.20.3 Change Log
=============================================

- added support for multiple marker series in the Google map component, with ability to show/hide 
each series through an interactive legend and ability to bring the map to its initial visual state 
using a custom reset button;

- introducing expression backed custom properties at report part level to allow attaching metadata to 
parts in multi-part documents, to be leveraged during report output post-processing by the parent application;

- allowing the creation of multi-part documents from single part (section based) report templates 
using a special custom property at report element level that triggers the creation of a separate part 
for the current page when the property is met;

- various dependencies upgrades including: Spring 5.3.26 and TestNG 7.7.0; 

- minor bug fixes and improvements;
